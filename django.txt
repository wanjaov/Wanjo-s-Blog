CREATING A DJANGO PROJECT
1. We create a django course project using the command:
 :\> django-admin startproject projectname

 Example:
    :\> django-admin startproject blog

-When we do this project folder is created with the name blog. Inside it there are two main components:
 1. The project's configuration folder, it contains all the configurations needed for the project to run.It also has the same name as the project i.e in this case it is also naed blog
 2. A file called manage.py :This is responsible for all commands made within the project.
 We can use it for:
        a. Running the seerver: python manage.py runserver
        b. Creaing an admin: python manage.py createsuperuser
        c. Making database migrations: python manage.py makemigration
        d. Migrating database changes: python manage.py migrate
        e. Collecting static: python manage.py collectstatic
    -These are just some of the commonly used commands
    NB: To be able to use these commands we must cd into the projects directory.
